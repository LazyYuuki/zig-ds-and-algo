# Basic Data Structure and Algorithm in Zig

This repository is a collection of basic DS and Algo implemented in pure Zig. It is meant to work as a reference and also as for own personal practice of using the language as well as the fundamental of computer science and why we do thing the way that we do.

The intention is to implemented the following:
- Linear
    - ðŸš§ Array 
    - ðŸš§ LinkedList
    - [ ] Stack
    - [ ] Queue

- Non-linear
    - [ ] Tree
        - [ ] Binary Search
        - [ ] AVL / Red-black
        - [ ] Heap
        - [ ] Trie
    - [ ] Graph
        - [ ] (Un)directed
        - [ ] (A)cyclic
        - [ ] (Un)weighted
    - [ ] Hash
